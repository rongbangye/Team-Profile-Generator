# Team-Profile-Generator

##  Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, I also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.
